# Workday-Planner Challenge 5
I created a work day planner app that lets the user save their plans through out the busy workday. This app will run in the browser via HTML,CSS using jQuery.

## Description
This is a simple work day application that works in the browswer using Day.js. Starting at the top of the page you can see the current date and time being displayed. Moving down to the center, on the left you have times starting at 7AM all the way down to 6pm. Next the user will be able to see if the times are in the past present and future with coresponding colors. To the right there the user wil find a save button that will save the text entered into the localstorage. Once hitting refresh, the text entered will still be displayed.
